As the CEO of a Private Equity firm in the Mariana Islands, Mike increased shareholder value significantly and led the operations, acquisition and development of several businesses. Ranging from airlines, to golf courses, to hotel and other tourism related businesses, Mike was able to really increase value. And in the telecom sector, ran a Cable TV company that entered the Internet and VOIP markets and exited at a large multiple. He also runs an Italian restaurant that makes amazing food!

## Scott Countryman

#### Executive Director at The Coral Triangle Conservancy, Inc.

I have known Mike for almost 30 years and he is a determined problem solver with the financial skills and strong work ethic to get through even the toughest challenges. As a wartime CEO or CFO Mike is great and is willing to handle just about any task if it helps the team win. He stepped in on short notice to serve as interim CFO of my last Company and led us past some very complicated tax issues while helping to set new standards for management by objectives. He was a team player in all aspects that built up the people around him to become great performers.\
\
I've also known Mike as a CEO growing large enterprise sized companies operating in a variety of industries in some of the most challenging business environments in the Pacific Rim. Mike knows how to run a large Company, manage a Board of Directors, charm investors with financial performance and fact based decision making, build great management teams, and set realistic business goals and deliver on them. He is an asset to any executive team or as a consultant to fly in and tackle your most difficult problems. I recommend Mike without reservations.
