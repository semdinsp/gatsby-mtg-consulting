I help companies prepare  applications for Covid relief. I have successfully submitted applications for PPP, EIDL grants, loan programs and SBA 7A and other SBA assistance programs. 

I  can provide references for successful applicants.  Furthermore, I have been successful in applying for covid relief for USA companies controlled by expats based in Asia .
